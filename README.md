 ## Description
The main goal of this application is to use the skills we learned in class to create a work day scheduler.

 Work day scheduler is the fifth challenge for the Ohio State coding bootcamp.
-	My motivation for this project was to become proficient at coding HTML, CSS, Javascript, and bootstrap.  
-	Building this project allowed me to implement coding techniques that I have been studying for the past 7 weeks. 
-	This page was a perfect example of real-world practices and solved the problem of assignments with starter code. 
-	I learned how to code and deploy a simple webpage with nothing more than HTML, CSS, Java Script, bootstrap, jquery, and
    google fonts.
